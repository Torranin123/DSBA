When we \"play\" a cell, the code in it is executed and it returns whatever is the result of running a code. (Maybe an error!)  You can modify and re-run code cells multiple times in any order. Importantly note that code cells will always start with \"`In [ ]:`\". \n",

    "\n",
    "When a code cell is executed, the code that it contains is sent to the ‘kernel‘ associated with the notebook (i.e. the Python engine running in the background). That is, some of the results of running a cell are \"remembered\" for subsequent cells, as long as the session continues running.  Usually the session keeps running as long as you don't stop your instance and you keep the notebook window open.  Sometimes when you get errors in running your cells, it's because something from a prior cell was forgotten for some reason.  If you look above under the dropdown menu Kernel above, you'll see that there are options for clearing your outputs, rerunning all the cells, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results that are returned from this computation are then displayed in the notebook as the cell’s output. Note that some code will not have an output.\n",
    "\n",

Typically this extension identifies programming language that was used to develop the script, with each language having been assigned a conventional extension. For example, a file called \"script_example.py\" is a file with python commands, and a file called \"script_example.R\" is a file with the R language commands. Other extensions that might be encountered include: \".cpp\", \".scala\", \".php\", \".rb\", \".sh\".\n",

    "Note that there are plenty of other more powerful text editors that provide other tools to boost productivity. Jupyter is convenient and easy to use, but if you've got a lot of code to write, you may consider [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/2), both of which have a shallow learning curve. I (Teerapong) also prefer [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to write Python scripts, which is also quite simple to use."
